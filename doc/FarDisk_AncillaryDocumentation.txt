* Summary

This program takes advantage of low-extinction windows in the Galactic
midplane to obtain a sample of luminous giants sampling the far
reaches of the Milky Way's disk. Windows are selected based on the
Marshall et al. (2006) 3D extinction map and luminous giants are
targeted using a simple (J-Ks)_0 > 0.8 color cut for stars with 12 < H
< 13. This sample will allow lopsided kinematic and chemical modes to
be mapped and provide an improved understanding of the warping and
flaring of the Milky Way's disk.

* Description

One of APOGEE-2's main scientific objectives is a comprehensive study
of the chemo-dynamical structure of a large volume of the Milky Way's
disk. However, while the main target selection for the disk of the
Milky Way will produce a large sample of stars at distances between 6
and ~9 kpc, the expected number of stars at these large distances in
the mid-plane will only be a few dozen, primarily because of the large
extinction.

With the availability of three-dimensional dust maps covering a large
fraction of the sky and a large range of extinctions (e.g., Marshall
et al. 2006; Green et al. 2015), it is now possible to identify
low-extinction windows in the inner Milky Way where stars at large
distances can be observed at relatively bright optical and infrared
magnitudes. While the dust is highly filamentary on small scales such
that most of the area of a typical APOGEE pointing in the mid-plane
suffers from high extinction, substantial fractions of a pointing can
cover low extinction regions. This ancillary program takes advantage
of these windows in three pointings (centered on l = 27 deg, l = 33
deg, and l = 65 deg; all at b = 0) combined with a red color cut
([J-K_s]_0 > 0.8) to create a sample of ~700 luminous giants at D >~ 6
kpc in the mid-plane. About 250 of these will have D >~ 15 kpc and
thus sample the disk at very large distances.

A sample of only a few hundred of stars in low-extinction windows
probing distances as far as 16 kpc a few magnitudes below the tip of
the red-giant branch significantly improves APOGEE-2's investigation
of the large-scale dynamics and metallicity structure of the
disk. Because of the low extinction, such stars will have highly
precise proper motions from Gaia (at large distances proper motions
due to Galactic rotation are a few mas/yr) that combined with APOGEE's
precise radial velocities allow the study of large-scale lopsided
modes in the disk and therefore more direct constraints on the
axisymmetric rotation (the rotation curve) than will be possible from
Gaia data alone. Similarly, a few hundred stars will allow the mean
metallicity at otherwise inaccessible regions of the Disk to be mapped
leading to much stronger constraints on the azimuthal chemical
homogeneity of the disk. The l = 65 deg field alsos sample the outer
disk in a region that is much less affected by the warp than that at l
= 180 deg, allowing for a cleaner study of the outer disk in that
qregion and for stronger constraints on the warp and flaring of the
disk by comparison with the l = 180 deg study.

* Target Selection Details

For each pointing, targets are selected in the region of the field for
which A_H(D=7kpc) <= 1.4. This A_H is computed from Marshall et
al. (2006)'s 3D extinction map on their native 15'x15' grid in (l,b)
using linear interpolation in distance and using A_H/A_Ks =
0.46/0.31. Targets in this region are selected from the 2MASS catalog
using the same 2MASS quality cuts and RJCE dereddening as the standard
APOGEE disk targets. All potential targets are obtained by selecting
stars with (J − Ks)_0 > 0.8 and 12 < H < 13. A random subset of these
are observed. Targets at the top of the list that were already
observed as part of the regular disk sample in the l = 34 and l = 64
disk fields are flagged, but not re-observed.
